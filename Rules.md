# Game Rules

## Setup

The board can be any size, but 10x10 is most common.

The white player moves first, by placing his King anywhere on the board.

The black player then plays his King anywhere, as long as it does not result in a check or stalemate.

## Mana

Each player starts with 1 mana and gains 1 mana at the start of his turn. Each card has a mana cost. Some Spell cards can permanently or temporarily add or remove mana from either or both players.

## Cards

After both Kings are placed, each player draws 7 cards. Cards can be of the following type:

1. A Creature
1. An Item
1. A Spell

### Creatures

When a Creature card is played, it must be placed on a square adjacent to its King unless otherwise stated on the Creature Card.

Different creatures have different movement abilities. In general, a given creature will move like a piece in chess: A Pawn, Queen, Root, Bishop, Knight.

Some creatures have special movement abilities like flying.

Most creatures have an Attack strengh and a Health amount.

When a creature lands on a square occupied by an enemy creature, they Battle. If a creature's health ever drops below zero, it is removed from the board and put in the Graveyard. Creatures with zero health are unconcious and cannot move. 

Some creatures can heal other creatures.

* Pawn. 1 mana, 1/1. Moves like pawns in Chess, including first move being two squares forward (at start of next turn). Can promote to a free use of any card in player's hand.
* Knight. 2 mana. 2/2. Moves like Knights in Chess.
* Bishop. 3 mana. 3/2. Moves like Bishops in Chess.
* Rook. 5 mana, 4/6. Moves like Rooks in Chess.
* Queen. 8 mana. 7/7. Moves like Queens in Chess.
* Barricade. 2 mana. 0/4. Doesn't move, and only Knights or Flying creatures can pass through.
* Trebuchet. 5 mana. 3/0. Doesn't move, and doesn't block. Can attack any square at most 2 squares away, orthogonally:

### Items

Items can be placed on Creatures to give them extra abilities or Attack or Health. Some typical items:

* Add N/M attack/health.
* Make Flying.
* Destroy creature.
* Heal creature.
* Damage creature.

### Spells

Spells can only be cast at the start of a player's turn. This is there turn. They cannot move creatures after casting a Spell.

## Ending

The game is over when a King is Checkmated, the game is in a Stalemate position, there have been three repitions of the same board state, or 50 moves have been played and no creatures have been created or killed.

# Other ideas

## Day/Night

Introduce a day/night cycle of 8 moves. At night, some creatures have special abilities like not taking damage when attacking. But they take 1 damage per turn in day light. Etc. Lots of scope for different mechanics here.

## Player Control

Players can take direct control of their creatures when battling, somewhat similar to battle-chess.
