# App.Model

Contains the models used by the system. Models simply store state and have no inherent behavior, other than to ensure internal consistency and applying business rules.

These are not aware of Unity runtime at all, and do not use MonoBehavior.

Models in this namespace provide persistence of the game, include save/replay and networking.
