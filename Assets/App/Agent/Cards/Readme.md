# App.Cards

Card-specific behavior.

Currently supported types are defined in _Database.CardTemplates_.

Eventually these will be be moved to a *Json* file with a custom Unity3d Editor view.

Planning to stay with King, Queen and Paladin for first few releases as they cover the core of the gameplay.
