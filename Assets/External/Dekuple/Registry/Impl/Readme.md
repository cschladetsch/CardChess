# Registry Implementation

This is split into three files that are all partial implementations of `Dekuple.Impl.Registry`:

* `Registry.cs` Contains the main logic and data-structures used by a Registry
* `Registry.Injection.cs` Performs field/property value injection and avoid cycles
* `Registry.Persistence.cs` Save/Load a Registry from a binary or text source.
