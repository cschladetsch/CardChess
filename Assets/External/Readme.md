# External

This folder contains external libraries and utilities not generally produced in-house.

The two exceptions are:

* CoLib. A library for animating MonoBehaviours over time.
* [Flow](https://github.com/cschladetsch/Flow/). A library written by me for managing co-routines via a non-singleton Kernel.
