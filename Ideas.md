# General Gameplay ideas.

## Complete Knowledge.

Unlike other TCGs, but like chess, both players have complete knowledge of the board, the states of all pieces, and the cards in the hands of their oppoents.

## Piece Spawn

Pieces can only spawn as if they moved from the King. As in, a Pawn can only spawn directly in front of King.

Knights can spawn anywhere a Knight could move from the King's position, and so on.

## Remove Damage and Health Completely?

Seems 'uncool', but may work best. How else to show Attack and Damage for each piece on board?

Hover over to see piece details?? Yuck.

Only use one value for each piece?

Attack is given by piece type, Damage is counted via vertical bar.

Can't use numbers. Show 'health' via vertical scaling?

How about using WASD and moving around the battlefeld? You only see the gneral overview from the top-down view, but can zoom in to units (pieces) to see statistics and effects, abilities. 

### Zooming

Can't show all information all the time. But, the world is 3D!

Tap a piece to see its stats.

Can double-tap a piece to see all the pieces it can 'see'.

Use WASD + Mouse to move around.


## Upgrades

Idea is that buildings can be made which automatically upgrade existing units and items and spells.

This brings and RTS element to the game.

* Buildings.
* Units.

## Buildings

Barricade   --> Stable
            --> Airy
            --> Barracks
            --> Church
            --> Smith

* Stable. Horse -> Warhorse.
* Barracks. Peon -> Knight
* Airy. Warhorse -> Gryphon
* Church. Peon -> Paladin. Archer -> Priest
* Smith. Upgrads all Items.

Etc.
