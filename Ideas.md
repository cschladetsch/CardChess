# Upgrades

Idea is that buildings can be made which automatically upgrade existing units and items and spells.

This brings and RTS element to the game.

* Buildings.
* Units.

## Buildings

Barricade   --> Stable
            --> Airy
            --> Barracks
            --> Church
            --> Smith

* Stable. Horse -> Warhorse.
* Barracks. Peon -> Knight
* Airy. Warhorse -> Gryphon
* Church. Peon -> Paladin. Archer -> Priest
* Smith. Upgrads all Items.

Etc.
