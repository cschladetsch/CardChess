# Card Chess

A Unity3d game inspired by TCGs and Chess.

Am taking the unusual option of using an architecture that largely ignores Unity.

Focusing on the gameplay and [rules](https://github.com/cschladetsch/Chess2/wiki), and only later will add interaction and visuals/audio.

Also, I intend to make all the art assets myself.

Ask me how it goes in 5 months' time.
