# Card Chess

A Unity3d game inspired by TCGs and Chess.

Am taking the unusual option of using an architecture that largely ignores Unity.

Focusing on the gameplay and rules, and only later will add interaction and visuals/audio.

Also, I intend to make all the art assets myself.

Ask me how it goes in 5 months' time.
